Terminology Explanations:
KenPom and Bart Torvik are two prominent college basketball analytics systems founded by Ken Pomeroy and Bart Torvik  respectively. They provide advanced statistics, rankings, and ratings for NCAA Division 1 men's basketball teams. You will see them come up quite a bit in this analysis. In the datasets, these will commonly be evident by a K or B prefix in front of a statistic (ex: KADJ O - KenPom Adjusted Offense).
